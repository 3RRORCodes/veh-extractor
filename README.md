# Vehicle Extractor (WIP)

This tool is made for **FiveM** server developers. It helps with organizing vehicle data by scanning folders, identifying vehicles, and categorizing them based on their names. It is still a **work in progress** (WIP), and more features will be added soon!

---

## What It Does
- Scans a folder of vehicles and organizes them into categories like police, EMS, fire, and others.
- Generates Lua files with the categorized vehicle data.
- Useful for creating organized vehicle data for your FiveM server.
